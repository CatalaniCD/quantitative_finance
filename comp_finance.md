# Computational Finance

Computational finance is a branch of applied computer science that 
deals with problems of practical interest in finance. 
Some slightly different definitions are the study of data and algorithms 
currently used in finance and the mathematics of computer programs that realize 
financial models or systems.

Computational finance emphasizes practical numerical methods rather 
than mathematical proofs and focuses on techniques that apply directly 
to economic analyses. It is an interdisciplinary field between mathematical 
finance and numerical methods. Two major areas are efficient and accurate 
computation of fair values of financial securities and 
the modeling of stochastic time series.
