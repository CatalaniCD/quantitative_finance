" TradingView has designed its own scripting language called Pine Script. It allows users to create custom indicators and run them on our servers. Pine was designed as a lightweight language focused on the specific task of developing indicators and strategies. Most of TradingViewâ€™s built-in indicators have been coded in Pine. It is our explicit goal to keep Pine accessible and easy to understand for the broadest possible audience.

Pine is cloud-based and therefore different in nature to client-side programming languages. While we will not develop Pine into a full-fledged language with high-end coding capabilities for building very complex tools, constantly improving Pine is one of our highest priorities and we are happy to consider any requests for new features."
