# Open Banking
Open banking is a financial services term as part of financial technology that refers to:

    1. The use of open APIs that enable third-party developers to build applications and services around the financial institution.
    2. Greater financial transparency options for account holders ranging from open data to private data.
    3. The use of open source technology to achieve the above.

Open banking, as a concept could be considered as a subspecies to the open innovation concept, a term promoted by Henry Chesbrough. It is linked to shifts in attitudes towards the issue of data ownership illustrated by regulations such as GDPR and concepts such as the open data movement. The banks turn into financial service platforms, technically implemented through a Banking as a Service-concept.
