### Mathematical Finance

Mathematical finance, also known as quantitative finance and financial mathematics, is a field of applied mathematics, concerned with mathematical modeling of financial markets. Generally, mathematical finance will derive and extend the mathematical or numerical models without necessarily establishing a link to financial theory, taking observed market prices as input. Mathematical consistency is required, not compatibility with economic theory. Thus, for example, while a financial economist might study the structural reasons why a company may have a certain share price, a financial mathematician may take the share price as a given, and attempt to use stochastic calculus to obtain the corresponding value of derivatives of the stock (see: Valuation of options; Financial modeling; Asset pricing). The fundamental theorem of arbitrage-free pricing is one of the key theorems in mathematical finance, while the Blackâ€“Scholes equation and formula are amongst the key results.

Mathematical finance also overlaps heavily with the fields of computational finance and financial engineering. The latter focuses on applications and modeling, often by help of stochastic asset models (see: Quantitative analyst), while the former focuses, in addition to analysis, on building tools of implementation for the models. In general, there exist two separate branches of finance that require advanced quantitative techniques: derivatives pricing on the one hand, and risk- and portfolio management on the other.

French mathematician Louis Bachelier is considered the author of the first scholarly work on mathematical finance, published in 1900. But mathematical finance emerged as a discipline in the 1970s, following the work of Fischer Black, Myron Scholes and Robert Merton on option pricing theory. Mathematical investing originated from the research of mathematician Edward Throp who used statistical methods to first invent card counting in blackjack and then applied its principles to modern systematic investing.

### Computational Finance
Computational finance is a branch of applied computer science that 
deals with problems of practical interest in finance. 
Some slightly different definitions are the study of data and algorithms 
currently used in finance and the mathematics of computer programs that realize 
financial models or systems.

Computational finance emphasizes practical numerical methods rather 
than mathematical proofs and focuses on techniques that apply directly 
to economic analyses. It is an interdisciplinary field between mathematical 
finance and numerical methods. Two major areas are efficient and accurate 
computation of fair values of financial securities and 
the modeling of stochastic time series.

Applications of Computational Finance :

    - Algorithmic Trading
    - Quantitative Investing
    - High Frequency Trading

### Financial Engineering
Financial engineering is a multidisciplinary field involving financial theory, 
methods of engineering, tools of mathematics and the practice of programming.
